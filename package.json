    "description": "Storyfile interactive interviews work by listening to a user’s question and playing back the video containing the best answer. The necessary elements are a resting pose video, played on loop, the answer video, and an “I can’t answer that” video if there is no appropriate answer given in the interview. The user interaction is a button that is held down to let the user speak, and released when they are finished.",
